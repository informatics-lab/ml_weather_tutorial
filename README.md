# ML Tutorial & Hackathon Prospectus 
Delivered by the Informatics Lab 


## Introduction 
In 2022, the Informatics Lab was asked to facilitate a machine learning hackathon for a team in the Met Office that was interested in applying ML to their area of research but felt they did not have the skills required to get started and so wanted to follow a pattern to other teams and organisation and have a concentrated team activity focused on ML to kick start things. The Informatics Lab was approached ads the leading data science and machine learning team in the Met Office to facilitate this.  

The success of hackathon, whatever the aims of the hackathon (for example in this case the main outcome is skills development, rather than protype development as it is in other hackathons), depends on the preparation. In the case of these hackathons, a lot of the participants are new to machine learning and so need some training to get up to speed or approach the subject in a more systematic before so they have the skills required to get the most from the hackathon. As a result, a tutorial was developed to be delivered over two half day sessions, with a gap in between to allow for the information to be digested and tried out.  

Another aspect of preparation is to have ideas fleshed out before the day so participants have a clear idea of what they will be doing during and what they want to get out of the time they spend on the hackathon. Part of this is that we have a time at the end of the tutorial to have an ideas generation session to flesh out ideas from day-to-day wok or that might have been stimulated by what was learned in the tutorial.  

This is also a time to decide what will need to be done in slower time between the tutorial and the hackathon itself. In particular, retrieve and organising data may take a long time (mostly waiting for copying and process rather than active involvement), so should be done before the hackathon so as to use the hackathon time most effectively 


## Basic Syllabus 
- Part 1 – Exploring your data 
- Part 2 – Building a machine learning pipeline
