    "So far in this series of notebooks, we have started by exploring a dataset we want to use with machine learning to tackle a particular problem, so that we understand the requirements and challenges of working with particular datasets. We have then made use of that knowledge to build a machine learning pipeline to tackle the problem. As a complement to the first notebook which seeks to understand the data, the third notebook looks at some of the details of how the algorithms work to help make appropriate choices for the components and hyperparameters of our machine learning pipeline. In this last notebook we will look at some techniques for making use of the knowledge of how the machine learning pipeline fits together to improve the performance of that pipeline for our problem of interest. We will look at these areas:\n",

    "### Importance of randomness in sampling data\n",
    "\n",
    "Random sampling is important for machine learning because a representative sample of your data will help toward modeling on independent data. Particularly to help to ensure that your model is not biased towards any particular group of data points / categories for classification, or learns spurious patterns in data. To give an example for either: When modelling extremes you ideally want to capture an extreme event in every sample that you feed to the model - feeding an all \"No event occurred\" batch to your model might make negative progress on your goals, similarly if data is not randomized you may encounter a decreasing number of extremes as you feed data to the model which will be particularly destructive in cases where your model is optimized to use weight momentum as your momentum will pick up toward the same undesirable \"no event occurred\" outcome. In our presented case below, while random tree classifiers use the entire training data to make algorithm decisions on, the problem can still be contextualized through an example where data split between train and test is not randomized, seasonal differences may be a factor in the problem and so the training data may not fully represent the whole population of our problem."

    "### Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we train our machine learning algorithm, we split our data into train and test subsets so we can evaluate the performance of the algorithm with data that has not been used to train the algorithm. There is an assumption that the particular split doesn't matter, but this is not always the case, especially where we are not familiar with the dataset that we are using and are less able to evaluate whether a split is suitable or not. What can happen is that a particular split may result in especially good or especially bad results, and generalise poorly to the test and validation sets if rare cases are not present in the training set. One way to get around this is to try multiple different splits and check whether results differ greatly between different splits. This is called cross validation. The way this is done is that after separating out your test set, the remaining data is then split again into train and validate sets. Typically this is done by dividing the data into n *folds* (by whatever means was used for splitting e.g. random, divide by time etc.). The you produced n different train/validate splits, each each using the members of one fold as the validation set and the rest as the training set. \n"

    "### Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "As we were setting up our machine learning  pipeline in notebook 2, in the step where were initialising and setting up the ML algorithm before training, we had to set a number of *hyperparameters* for each algorithm. For example we had to set the maximum depth for a decision tree, the number of estimators (i.e. the number of decision trees) in the random forest, and the number of layers and nodes in each layer for a neural network. These were just set to a particular value that are known to be reasonable for that problem. In general when we start a new problem, we can't be so sure we know what is a reasonable value for those hyperparameters.One may have some intuition to guide the choice based on similarity to other problems, but in general one needs to tweak these and do some trial and error experimentation find the values that give the best performance for a particular problem. This process is known as *hyperparameter tuning*. Each run with a different set of hyperparameters is called a *trial*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general there is no good systematic way to determine the best hyperparameters. Typically, one needs to train the algorithm a lot of times with different hyperparameters to find the best combination for your problem. Unfortunately the results tend to be quite non-linear, limiting the ability to perform a systematic iterative optimisation. The two most comment methods are\n",
    "* *grid search* - Grid a grid of regularly space value in the hyperparameter space, train an algorithm with each of the combinations on the grid and select the combination that gives the best results.\n",
    "* *random search* - Specify a distribution for each of the hyperparameters, get n random samples from the distributions, train an algorithm with each and select the hyperparameter combination that gives the best result.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other methods that try to be smarter about selecting based on previous results, and also more exotic method like genetic algorithms. For most problems grid or random search is sufficient. Grid is more comprehensive but costly, so random is often used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of training an algorithm many times is of course very costly, but also very easy to run multiple trials in parallel. See the notes at the bottom of the notebook for more information about tools to help scale up hyperparameter tuning."

The algorithm will sample each distribution for each trial. We specify how many trials to run with the argument `n_iter`. Here are using hyperparameters with integer values so we are just randomly selecting with equal chance. Other hyperparameters have real values. We may want to use different distributions for these, such as uniform or normal distributions, or more specific distributions if we know more about what sot of values a hyperparameter should take on.

    "All of these steps can be expensive, so sometime we just need to do as much as we can with the data that we have. In particular fr the first problem of under represented classes known as the class imbalance problem, we can resample the data to create a dataset that appears balanced. Although this might seem like it doesn't achieve anything, it can be very helpful. Usually this is a combination of the following tasks:\n",
    "* undersampling - take a subset of classes that are most common or over represented\n",
    "* oversampling - taking repeat samples of underrepresented classes\n",
    "* synthetic samples - If you know enough about the data that you can create a distribution from which to create synthetic samples, this another option for oversampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the art for resampling uses a combination of these, such as  Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).\n",

    "\n",
    "Data-driven techniques are often presented, and have often been used, as black box techniques. That is, we throw the data an algorithm, and gives us some answers but we don't understand how or why it gives us those answers. This has already caused many problems in the real world where algorithms have been used in places that affect people lives, for example in the justice system or approving bank loans, where people have been negatively affected and there has been no recourse to challenge the decision of an algorithm. In many ways this is the fault of the overall human system and how it uses machine learning, rather than the algorithm itself, but it highlights the importance of building trust in the results produced by an ML algorithm. One way to do this is to be able to explain how a result was made and interpret what the real world impact of such a result will be and if that makes sense. The field of explaining and interpreting ML results,rather than just using ML as a black box, is called *Explainable AI* or *XAI*.\n",
